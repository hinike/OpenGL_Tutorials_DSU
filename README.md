# OpenGL @ DSU
Accompanying git repo for the OpenGL Tutorials Facebook Group at DSU (https://www.facebook.com/groups/344589342409097/). This is targetting beginners esp. undergraduate students from DSU or any other university for that matter as long as the intent is to learn basic computer graphics in C/C++.

These tutorials are bound to my lectures taken each Tuesday. Each week, exercise will be given and the next week the 
exercise solution will be given for active learning.

# Required Libraries
